# MPEGDashSimulator

This code was developed to be used as a GUILess DASH client simulator. The idea was to code something that would simulate the traffic generated by a MPEG DASH client. It just requests chunks from a BigBuckBunny mirror repository, calculates the bitrate and changes the bitrate for the next chunk if necessary. It is very simple and straight forward. 

The mechanism to update bitrate was based on the code found at https://github.com/dazedsheep/DASH-JS.

The repository used to get video chunks was http://www-itec.uni-klu.ac.at/dash/?page_id=207
